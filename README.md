# swaggerPetStoreReact
Swagger Pet Store React project.

[Launch Site here](https://ericenergy.github.io/swaggerPetStoreReact/#/).

This app is hosted here on Github for your viewing pleasure. 

This app is made to demo my current skills in React. You can choose the class component route or the functional component route. 

Both work exactly the same but I wanted to show that I am proficent in working with both.
